# Overview {#usb-console-overview}

The device provides a serial console over the USB port. This allows a
[terminal emulator](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulation)
such as [minicom](http://linux.die.net/man/1/minicom) (Unix) or
[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

The settings are 8N1, at 9600 baud.

The console provides different log levels. The +/- keys can be used to
increase / decrease the log level. Press the 'h' key to see a list of
commands.
