DMX / RDM Controller {#controller}
=======================

[TOC]

# Overview {#controller-overview}

The device will automatically switch to controller mode when it's configured as
an output port within OLA.

# Biasing & Termination {#controller-biasing}

For correct operation, RDM networks need to be
[biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biasing) appropriately. This requires
two things:

- Biasing at the controller side.
- A terminator on the last responder in the DMX chain.

See your manufacturer's instructions for how to set the correct biasing for
your device.
