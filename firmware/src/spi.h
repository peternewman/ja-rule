 * @brief SPI Driver
 *
 * This driver allows multiple clients to share the SPI bus. This assumes that
 * all clients use the same SPI configuration. If that isn't the case we'll
 * need to introduce client handles or something.
 *
 * Clients can queue an SPI transfer with the SPI_QueueTransfer() method. The
 * callback argument can be used to specify a callback to be run before and
 * after the transfer is performed. This callback can be used to set the
 * relevant chip-enable line.
