 * @brief The API for an RDM Model implementation.
 *
 * In combination with the RDMHandler, the Model API provides a flexible method
 * of supporting multiple RDM models on a single physical device. Only one model
 * may be active at once.
 *
 * Each model provides a ModelEntry struct, which contains function
 * pointers for the model's implementation. To add a new model, implement the
 * functions within ModelEntry and then add the ModelEntry to the
 * RDMHandler by calling RDMHandler_AddModel().
